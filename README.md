# MAZE-XPLORER_TECHNEX2019
-a robot capable of solving a Maze and following a given trajectory

## Problem Statement:
To make a line following robot with the ability to solve a given maze and also detec ovr-head nodes placed along the path.
Detailed PS:[Problem_Statement](https://github.com/lok-i/MAZE-XPLORER_TECHNEX2019/blob/master/Robonex_Maze-Xplorer.pdf)


## Our solution:
* We used PID to make the our custom built robot to follow the line.
* An altered version of the Left-Hand Rule was used to solve the maze in level 2.The tradition algorithm was ignored when a      double node was detected as dictated but the PS.

## Hardware Used:

• Self designed chasis with PolyCarbonate Sheet for light weight yet firm mechanical integrity of the structure
• Arduino Mega
• BO motors
• Proximity sensor (to detect over head nodes)
•  QTR 8RC ,sensor array for line detection.
